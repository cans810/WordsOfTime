# Binary Formatter Save System

This implementation provides a robust save system using a binary formatter approach that has been proven to work reliably on Android.

## Overview

The implementation consists of:

1. `SimpleSaveSystem.cs` - A static class that handles saving and loading using BinaryFormatter
2. `SaveManager.cs` - The main manager that uses SimpleSaveSystem for all platforms
3. `AndroidSaveTest.cs` - A utility script for testing the save system

## How It Works

The game now uses a single, consistent approach for saving and loading on all platforms:

1. The `SimpleSaveSystem` uses BinaryFormatter to serialize and deserialize the `SaveData` object
2. The system creates backups before saving to prevent data loss
3. Temporary files are used during saving to prevent corruption
4. The system includes robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Testing the Save System

To test the save system:

1. Add a UI button to your game scene
2. Add the `AndroidSaveTest` component to the button
3. Assign a TextMeshProUGUI component to the `statusText` field
4. Set the button's onClick event to call one of these methods:
   - `TestSimpleSaveSystem()` - Tests saving and loading with the SimpleSaveSystem
   - `DisplaySaveInfo()` - Shows information about the save files
   - `DeleteSaveFiles()` - Deletes all save files

## Implementation Details

### SimpleSaveSystem

The `SimpleSaveSystem` uses a BinaryFormatter to serialize and deserialize the `SaveData` object. This approach has been proven to work reliably on Android in other games.

Key features:
- Creates backups before saving
- Uses temporary files to prevent corruption
- Includes robust error handling
- Verifies file permissions

### SaveManager

The `SaveManager` has been simplified to:
- Use only the SimpleSaveSystem for all platforms
- Include a test method for the SimpleSaveSystem
- Handle all game data saving and loading through a consistent interface

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Use the `DisplaySaveInfo()` method to check if save files exist
3. Try the `TestSimpleSaveSystem()` method to test the save system directly
4. Verify file permissions using the `VerifyFilePermissions()` method
5. If all else fails, use `DeleteSaveFiles()` to start fresh

## Notes

- The BinaryFormatter approach is generally more reliable on Android than JSON
- Text files are still created for debugging purposes
- The system includes backup creation and recovery mechanisms
- All platform-specific code has been removed for a more consistent experience
