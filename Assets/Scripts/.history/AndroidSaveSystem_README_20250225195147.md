# Android Save System Implementation

This implementation provides a more robust save system for Android by using a binary formatter approach that has been proven to work in other Android games.

## Overview

The implementation consists of:

1. `SimpleSaveSystem.cs` - A static class that handles saving and loading using BinaryFormatter
2. Modifications to `SaveManager.cs` to use both the original JSON approach and the new BinaryFormatter approach
3. `AndroidSaveTest.cs` - A utility script for testing the save system on Android

## How It Works

On Android, the game will now:

1. First try to save using the BinaryFormatter approach (SimpleSaveSystem)
2. Then also save using the JSON approach as a backup
3. When loading, first try to load using the BinaryFormatter approach
4. If that fails, fall back to the JSON approach
5. If both fail, try to recover from backups
6. If all recovery attempts fail, create a new save

## Testing on Android

To test the save system on Android:

1. Add a UI button to your game scene
2. Add the `AndroidSaveTest` component to the button
3. Assign a TextMeshProUGUI component to the `statusText` field
4. Set the button's onClick event to call either:
   - `TestSimpleSaveSystem()` - Tests saving and loading with the SimpleSaveSystem
   - `DisplaySaveInfo()` - Shows information about the save files

## Implementation Details

### SimpleSaveSystem

The `SimpleSaveSystem` uses a BinaryFormatter to serialize and deserialize the `SaveData` object. This approach has been proven to work reliably on Android in other games.

Key features:
- Creates backups before saving
- Uses temporary files to prevent corruption
- Includes robust error handling
- Verifies file permissions

### SaveManager Modifications

The `SaveManager` has been modified to:
- Use both save systems on Android
- Try to load from both systems
- Include a test method for the SimpleSaveSystem
- Delete files from both systems when deleting saves

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Use the `DisplaySaveInfo()` method to check if save files exist
3. Try the `TestSimpleSaveSystem()` method to test the save system directly
4. Verify file permissions using the `VerifyFilePermissions()` method

## Notes

- The BinaryFormatter approach is generally more reliable on Android than JSON
- Both approaches are used for redundancy
- Text files are still created for debugging purposes
- The system includes multiple layers of backups and fallbacks
